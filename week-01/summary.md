# Week 1 Summary

## 🌟 Goals:
- (MATH) Watch introductory linear algebra videos and read the first chapter of the textbook
- (CS) Start a new mini project based on recusion (cs106B topic)
- (JS/Frontend) Do more research and understand what are the uses of tools previous to my internship

## 🎖️ What I achieved this week:
✅ Math51: started reading the textbook and watched videos  
✅ CS106B: reviewed recursion
✅ JS/Frontend: explored DOM manipulation and basic layout

💡 Highlights:  
- Learned about convex combinations in linear algebra  
- Refreshed how function calls work in recursive code  

🎯 Next week:  
- Finish Chapter 1 of Math51  
- Build a small frontend component with JS
