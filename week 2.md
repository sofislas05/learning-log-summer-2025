# Week 2
This week has been a little different. I caught the Flu, so I had to stay home and rest for a while. However, I still felt well enough to continue learning and working remotely.

## Day 1:
I worked on 2 issues from the Ideal project today. I started and finished one issue related to a scroll bug on the webpage, and also worked on deploying the web application via Docker. I researched and learned how to write Dockerfiles and Docker-compose files. 
By the end of the day, I felt very accomplished. Because even though I could not finish with the Docker configuration, I learned a lot, and tried new things. After hours, I rested and also had an idea: start a project using Astro, CSS, HTML... (TLDR: all the technologies I was using for Ideal).
I started with the design of Clau's Kitchen, a webpage where my mom can share all her favorite recipes, and also expand our culture through her Paraguayan dishes. I designed with Figma, and since I am a student, I could access the student plan. This was very helpful.

## Day 2:
On day 2, I continued working on the deployment with Docker, which, honestly, was not my favorite part. The deployment was successful after a couple of hours; there were problems with my device's access permissions. That day, I also faced some trouble with my git branches. Since I could not count on Profe Ale's help most of the time, I experimented a lot. But when you don't know what you are doing, you can accidentally erase all dependencies and stuff like that. So, I am very happy I could just schedule a call with Profe Ale and we could fix what I broke in about 40 minutes. After doing the deploy with Docker, we tried to make a second deployment, in a production environment, also with Docker. However, this time it was a little different: after some hours of confusion and a zillion errors, we noticed that there were configurations that were out of our hands (decisions we could not take as we were not the owners of this open source project). So Profe Ale and I decided to pospose this issue for now. The UAT interface was an additional feature we wanted to add, but it was not required. After hours, I continued with Clau's Kitchen, and started the development with Astro of the Home page.

## Day 3:
I worked on an issue for the WHOLE day! It was about a semester filter/menu that was buggy. I fixed the bugs, implementing localStorage in the scripts. I used git to share my changes and later discussed my changes with Profe Ale. That day, I was not feeling very well, so I took it easy and rested. 


## Day 4:
I went back to the UAT issue and worked more deeply with the .prod versions of the dockerfile and docker compose. I learned that they used CloudFlare pages to deploy the website, so I got the environment ready to test this new feature. That day, I continued reviewing my changes from Ideal and followed some suggestions to make the code cleaner.
