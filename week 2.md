# Week 2
This week has been a little different. I caught the Flu, so I had to stay home and rest for a while. However, I still felt well enough to continue learning and working remotely.

## Day 1:
I worked on 2 issues from the Ideal project today. I started and finished one issue related to a scroll bug on the webpage, and also worked on deploying the web application via Docker. I researched and learned how to write Dockerfiles and Docker-compose files. 
By the end of the day, I felt very accomplished. Because even though I could not finish with the Docker configuration, I learned a lot, and tried new things. After hours, I rested and also had an idea: start a project using Astro, CSS, HTML... (TLDR: all the technologies I was using for Ideal).
I started with the design of Clau's Kitchen, a webpage where my mom can share all her favorite recipes, and also expand our culture through her Paraguayan dishes. I designed with Figma, and since I am a student, I could access the student plan. This was very helpful.
