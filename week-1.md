# Week 1 - Cardinal Quarter Learning Log

## Day 1
Today I started my 2025 Summer internship at SODEP S.A. a Paraguayan software development company. I started working with my mentor, Ale  Feltes, who is a Computer Science professor at the Catholic University of Asunción, the most prestigious private university in the country. 

I started talking with my mentor about the technologies and new learning I would need to acquire for the project. These technologies include JavaScript, Node.js, Astro, and Git. Since I know Git is very important for colaborative projects, before starting the internship, I studied the Git workflow and took a couple courses. This previous knowledge helped me with my first task, a very easy but important: use Git and expand the project's README. 

I finished the task, commited to GitHub and pushed to my own branch. However, I learned that for every commit, it is important to write messages that follow certain conventions, so the colaboration does not get confusing. I learned commands like amend, and later practiced the Git workflow with an online platform that helped me to gamemify the Git learning process. The platform's name is (https://learngitbranching.js.org/?locale=es_AR). At the end of the day, I reflected on today's learning, noticed what I can do better and continue with the good work. 

PS: I am also using Git to push this to this repository yay!

## Day 2
On day 2, I continued learning about front-end technologies. I started with an Astro tutorial from Astro Docs (https://docs.astro.build/en/tutorial). I advanced until stage 2, with 2 left to go to stage 3. I was really enjoying this tutorial, I learned about deployment and kept practicing with Git. However, I was starting to face some issues: I was starting to get confused with CSS and JavaScript. I decided to pause and study/do a course to better understand these technologies.

I started a short Javascript course, watched some videos, and asked questions to some of my peers who use JavaScript on their projects. A technique I find very helpful is to write on paper or on my iPad what I learn from courses and videos online. Writing things by myself makes it easier for me to retain information.

On day two, I also had the first part of the New Member Orientation, where they explained to me the mission, vision, and values of the company.

## Day 3
Day 3 was fun. My mentor, Prof. Ale Feltes, shared a command line (zsh.) tutorial with me, since I did not know how to use the command line properly. I watched it, took notes and finally understood how to manage files, open them to code and move along my computer's directory. The video I watched that was very helpful to me was: (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ogWoUU2DXBU&t=1s). I also would like to emphasize that I always try to follow tutorials and videos live, meaning I like to code along, do the steps at the same time, and write notes. I do not recommend passively watching videos without any notetaking/coding along. 

After that, I watched a Udemy tutorial and soon created a simple webpage that helped me undestand better what I was doing. Finally, with help of AI, I started learning JavaScript too. I asked ChatGPT about a simple guide to learn the coding language, and I believe the instructions AI gave me were very concise and useful. 

On day three, I also got introduced to new people from the company, I met Nelson Canatta, full stack developer and part of the directing team, and talked with Sindy Pizzurno, project manager of the company. I really enjoyed our conversations, they were technical and interesting. That is where I started to realize how much I was growing and learning.

## Day 4
On day 4, I had two very important meetings. In the morning, I spoke with my mentor Prof. Ale Feltes, and talked about the IDEAL Project, the project I am doing Cardinal Quarter for. We talked abuot the uncertainties we had about the project, about the deployment of the project, how automatic the deployment was, if they had different evironments for production and development, etc. We also talked about the different issues on the GitHub, and how I will be able to contribute. I took notes of what we talked about and make a visual summary to later show Adán and Christopher, the IDEAL Project owners.

The second meeting was with Adán and Christopher, and they explained to us how the whole project works. From deployment to new features, they showed us that they are going through a big change right now: they are changing from Keystatic to Lexical, which would completely change the logic of aspects of the project. They suggested me to checkout an specific Astro tutorial, and my mentor suggested me to do some research about how debugging works on Astro. I continued my day playing with new Astro projects and watching the tutorial.
