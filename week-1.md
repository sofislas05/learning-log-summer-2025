# Week 1 - Cardinal Quarter Learning Log

## Day 1
Today I started my 2025 Summer internship at SODEP S.A. a Paraguayan software development company. I started working with my mentor, Ale  Feltes, who is a Computer Science professor at the Catholic University of Asunci√≥n, the most prestigious private university in the country. 

I started talking with my mentor about the technologies and new learning I would need to acquire for the project. These technologies include JavaScript, Node.js, Astro, and Git. Since I know Git is very important for colaborative projects, before starting the internship, I studied the Git workflow and took a couple courses. This previous knowledge helped me with my first task, a very easy but important: use Git and expand the project's README. 

I finished the task, commited to GitHub and pushed to my own branch. However, I learned that for every commit, it is important to write messages that follow certain conventions, so the colaboration does not get confusing. I learned commands like amend, and later practiced the Git workflow with an online platform that helped me to gamemify the Git learning process. The platform's name is (https://learngitbranching.js.org/?locale=es_AR). At the end of the day, I reflected on today's learning, noticed what I can do better and continue with the good work. 

PS: I am also using Git to push this to this repository yay!
