# Week 3
Back to the office!!!

## Day 1:
I felt soooo productive that day! I finished another of Ideal's issues, another bug that had to do with the size of the tables on screen, and how these tables were overflowing. I felt amazing after fixing that bug, since it took me many hours (Almost the whole day). After hours, I went back home and wrapped up my project, and showed it to my mom. She was sooo happy!

## Day 2:
I felt so happy with the result of Clau's Kitchen, I asked Profe Ale if I could use some time to deploy the webpage. He accepted and recommended that I use GitHub Pages. I feel the result is great! (See my Clau's Kitchen repo!). After doing that, I have been introduced to a new challenge, a project that had involved SQL. I have never, ever, touched code with databases involved. I was scared and genuinely confused. I watched many tutorials and asked questions to my mentors and coworkers. The research took me a while, but it helped me to have a strong base for when I start to touch code like that.

## Day 3:
The SQL challenge is HERE! Profe Ale presented me a small project in Java, Apache Tomcat, and also used PostgreSQL. My job was to deploy this project on a Docker-compose file. It seemed easy, since I had already done something like that before. However, I did not notice all the issues the project had when creating tables. I had to use a lot of AI for this one, Gemini and Copilot being the best tutors. I learned a lot on these very long hours of debugging. But you know what? I made it! And I feel very proud of myself.

## Day 4:
Day 4 was very challenging. We worked with a coworker on testing the docker I set up from her computer, in the process I learned a lot about Apache tomcat and how exactly PosgresSQL works. It was kind of a long challenge, and Katty (my coworker) helped me with the process. At the end, we commited the changes, and Profe Ale tried them by himself, everything worked out! On day 4 they also talked with me about adding me to another project, since I have made a lot of progress.  

## Day 5:
On day 5 I worked on the last issue of Ideal, I worked on the Back Button. It was challengnig but also fun. I learned a lot about the project, because I worked in files I have not worked before. And besides that, at first I had trouble with the placement of the Button, since it was relative to each page's title. However, everything turned out great at the end. Finally, I commited my new changes on a new branch "testing", where Profe Ale first tried every change and then told me to let Ideal's owners know about all my changes. Now, the changes are under review from Ideal, and I feel very happy about my contributions.
